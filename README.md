FontAwesome Filter
=========================
This filter allows you to use fontawesome icons in the Moodle text editor without worrying about having your div's stripped out by the Moodle Tinymce HTML cleaner.

Requirements
=========================
Moodle 2.6+

This filter now provides FontAwesome 4 by means of: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Themes_overview#Adding_custom_fonts in M2.6+.

Installation
=========================
Install the plugin like any other plugin to folder /filter/fontawesome

See http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins

Usage
=========================
First, activate the filter_tabs plugin in Site Administration -> Plugins -> Filters -> Manage filters

To create FontAwesome icons in textfields, use the following syntax: [fa-*] where * is the name of the icon you wish to display

Settings
=========================
filter_fontawesome has a settings page to allow you to limit the filter to only certain textbox formats.

Still to be done
=========================
I am still figuring out how to add an abilityt  o detect a custom variable to allow the user to set the icon size.
